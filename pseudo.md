# Pseudocode
- Plain language description of the stelps in an algorithm or a program.
- Bridge between the programs logic and the actual code.

## Importance 
- Helps to understand and plan the program logic, so its easier to code.
- Improves collaborations in team projects
- Helps with troubleshooting
- Identify the core areas of the programming that needs to be done.

## Characteristics:
- Plain language: Simple and understandable 
- Structured: Follows a proper logic sequence 
- Abstracted: Focuses on logic more than the syntex 
- Detailed: Thorough walkthrough that helps explain the logic

## Basic Constructs
- Sequential
```
    Step 1: do this
    Step 2: do that
```

- Conditional
```
    If condifion Then
        do something
    ELSE
        Do something else
```

- Loops 
```
    WHILE condition meets
        Do something
    END WHILE
```

```
    FOR EACH item in collection
        Do something
    END FOR
```

## Practise Examples

- Example 1: Calculating the sum oof a list of numbers
```
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    Initialise sum to 0
    FOR each number in the list
        ADD the number to sum
    END FOR
    PRINT sum

```
- Example 2: Finding the maximum number in a list
```
    Initialise max to the first number of the list
    FOR each number in the list
        IF number is greater than max THEN
            Set max to number
        END IF
```
